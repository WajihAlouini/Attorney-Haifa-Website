Law **No. 2025-9 of 21 May 2025** is the most sweeping change to Tunisia's Labour Code in a generation. Designed to end precarious employment, it fundamentally reshapes how private companies operate.

Whether you run an SME, a startup, or a multinational with a Tunisian office, here is your practical guide to the key changes.

## Permanent Contracts Are Now the Default

The new law inverts the historic norm of widespread fixed-term contract abuse.

- The **Permanent Contract (CDI)** is now the **legally mandated default** for all employment relationships.
- **Fixed-Term Contracts (CDD)** are now strictly limited to genuinely temporary situations: seasonal work, specific one-off projects, or temporary replacement of an absent employee.
- Any CDD renewed beyond the legally prescribed limit is **automatically converted to a CDI** by the Labour Inspectorate. Employers face heavy financial penalties.

> **Legal Advice**: Audit your workforce now. Any expiring CDD risks automatic reclassification under the new rules.

## The End of Labour Outsourcing

The most controversial change is the **formal prohibition of labour outsourcing** for a company's core business activities.

Companies routinely used staffing agencies and subcontractors to avoid direct social charges. No more.

- Outsourced workers performing the company's **core business** must be directly integrated.
- Existing subcontracting agreements must be reviewed and regularised urgently.
- Only specific peripheral services (cleaning, security, specialist maintenance) remain permitted under newly tightened conditions.

## Tripled Fines and a Strengthened Labour Inspectorate

The Labour Inspectorate's powers have been dramatically reinforced. Penalties for contract violations or unfair dismissal have been **multiplied by three**.

Additionally, the law fast-tracks employee access to the Labour Tribunal (Conseil de Prud'hommes) for contract reclassification disputes.

## What Should Companies Do Now?

The law entered into force on 24 May 2025 with no grace period.

1. **HR Mapping**: Identify all employees currently on CDDs and all outsourced workers immediately.
2. **Update Contract Templates**: Your old CDD templates are almost certainly non-compliant. The legal grounds for a fixed-term contract must now be explicit and undeniable.
3. **Subcontracting Audit**: Consult a labour law specialist to determine whether your current service agreements could be reclassified as prohibited labour outsourcing.
