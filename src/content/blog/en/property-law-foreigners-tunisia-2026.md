Buying property in Tunisia as a foreign national or a non-resident Tunisian is an attractive opportunity — but one governed by strict legal rules. With new reforms on the horizon, understanding the current framework is essential before you sign anything.

## The Golden Rule: The Governor's Permit

Unlike property purchases in Europe, buying real estate in Tunisia as a foreigner requires **prior authorisation from the Governor** of the region where the property is located.

### What Is Permitted (with approval):

- Apartments and secondary residences in urban areas.
- Bare land for residential construction within a municipal perimeter.
- Commercial premises for a licensed economic activity.

### What Is Strictly Prohibited:

- **Agricultural land** cannot be purchased by foreigners. Tunisian law firmly protects national farmland.

## A Secure Step-by-Step Acquisition Process

Never sign a final deed or transfer full payment before obtaining the Governor's authorisation.

### 1. The Preliminary Sale Agreement (Compromis)

This document must be drafted professionally — ideally by a lawyer. It **must include a suspensive clause** making the sale conditional on receiving the Governor's permit. A deposit of 10-20% is typical, but must be fully refundable if the authorities refuse.

### 2. Currency Transfer and the "Investment Certificate"

For future repatriation of your proceeds upon resale, the purchase funds must come from abroad.

- Wire your currency to a Tunisian account from overseas.
- Obtain a **Foreign Investment Certificate** ("Fiche d'Investissement") from the Banque Centrale de Tunisie, proving the currency was imported. This is your financial guarantee.

### 3. Submitting the Dossier to the Governor's Office

The application is extensive: ID documents, criminal record certificates from your home country, property title deeds, floor plans, and more. A lawyer is highly recommended to prevent administrative delays. Typical response time: 3-6 months.

### 4. The Final Deed and Land Registry

Once authorisation is secured, the final deed is signed, duty is paid at the Revenue Office, and ownership is registered at the Land Registry (Conservation de la Propriété Foncière), giving you the official "Blue Title".

## An Upcoming Legislative Reform

A new draft law is in preparation to modernise the foreign property framework, aimed at:

- Regularising the status of certain foreign-occupied properties.
- Simplifying and accelerating acquisition procedures to attract new investment.
